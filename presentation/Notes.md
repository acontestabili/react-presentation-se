- Introduce React
- Live Demo
- Why & How-to use it at Secret Escapes
- QAs

# What is React
- Library (not framework), not too opinionated
- Declarative style describes User Interfaces
- Reusable Components
- Just JavaScript and HTML
- Encourages synchronous unidirectional flow
- Easy to write tests for
- Can be written with static types


# How React became the Queen (or King) of UI
- DOM is too slow, two way binding is slower
- Virtual DOM is Fast
- Components are future of the web
- Modern Developer tools: hot reloading
- SEO friendly
- Mobile Apps
- code splitting, lazy loading, progressive web enhancement
- load css/js for component


# It's fast
It's [fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5e7kWSHWTg&s#t=03m30s) as opposed to two-way binding

# JavaScript: a short history

A long long time ago

jQuery
Two-way Binding

Problems
- Slow
- Spaghetti Code
- Bad Developer Experience
- DOM manipulation - slow on most clients
- Bundled with backend

# React
Why?
- Fast
- Good Patterns
- Developer Experience
- Learn Once, Use Everywhere
- React Native
- Community
- Copied - Angular 2/4, ReactXP (MS), Dart one (Google) Vue

How?
- Single Page App (or Not - unlike many alternatives)
- Virtual DOM
- Stateless and Higher Order functions
- Component architecture
- Single Directional Flow (TM)
- Props & State

# Bonus
- Hot Reloading
- Pure functions
- Types
- Good for testing: unit test, snapshot, end-to-end
- Matured (TM) Instagram.com, facebook.com
